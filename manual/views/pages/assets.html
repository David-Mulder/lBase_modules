	<h1>Assets</h1>
</div>
<p>
	Styling and images are assets and can be placed in the <i>/assets/</i> directories of the application or modules.
</p>
<h2>Module asset directories</h2>
<p>
	After adding an asset directoy it's necessary to trigger the <i>/admin/assets/regenerate</i> page to regenerate the url rule file.
</p>
<h2>Asset preprocessors</h2>
<p>
	Asset preprocessors are defined in the system itself and preprocess a certain type of file. This can be used to for example support .less (less.js) and .coffee (coffeescript) files. Default .less files are supported only. Practically this means you can drop .less files into your asset folders and treat it as if it's a css file.
